# Bird Species Prediction 🦩

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify bird species from images. 
By training a deep learning model on a diverse dataset, the system can identify various bird species, 
making it a valuable tool for ornithologists, bird enthusiasts, and conservationists.

## Overview 🌍

The Bird Species Prediction project employs a CNN to classify bird species based on input images. 
The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing images of various bird species, enabling it to recognize and predict species with high accuracy.

## Features 🌟

Accurate Classification: Achieves high accuracy in identifying bird species from images.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple interface for easy integration into applications.
Extensive Dataset: Trained on a diverse set of bird images to ensure robustness.
Open-Source: Freely available for modification and enhancement.

## Getting Started 🚀

To set up the Bird Species Prediction system locally, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites 🛠️
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
pip
Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

## Installation 🏗️
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/XXXXX/bird-species-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd bird-species-prediction

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage 🧑‍💻
Prepare your dataset by placing images in the designated directory.

Train the model using the provided script:
python train_model.py

Use the trained model to make predictions:
python predict.py --image path_to_image.jpg

## Model Architecture 🏗️

The model is built using Keras with TensorFlow backend. It consists of the following layers:

Convolutional Layers: Extract features from input images.
Max-Pooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions.
Flatten Layer: Convert 2D matrices to 1D vectors.
Dense Layers: Perform classification based on extracted features.
Output Layer: Softmax activation function to output probabilities for each class.
For a detailed explanation of the architecture, refer to the Keras documentation.

## Training the Model 🏋️

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. 
Categorical crossentropy is used as the loss function, suitable for multiclass classification problems. 
The model is trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 128.

For more information on compiling models in Keras, refer to the Keras API documentation.

## Evaluation 📊

After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a separate validation dataset. 
Metrics such as accuracy and loss are recorded to assess the model's effectiveness.
